# Arweave Todo App

A todo app deployed onto [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) — a decentralized data storage protocol that stores data in perpetuity.

## Demo

Just code & demo to explore Arweave — users probably don't want to pay AR for every single CRUD operation. Get some [free AR](https://faucet.arweave.net) to use the todo app.
